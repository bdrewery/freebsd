.\" $FreeBSD$
Set this if you do not want to install any static libraries.
This will create an installation that cannot compile since
critical system libraries will be missing.
For example, this can be useful when creating a
.Xr nanobsd 8
image.
.Bf -symbolic
The option does not work for build targets.
.Ef
.Sy WITHOUT_STATIC_LIBS
can be used to avoid compiling static libraries and also still install
critical libraries.
